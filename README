Using Owl Graph in Windows:

Owl Graph is a collection of Python scripts employing numpy and pygtk. As such, running Owl Graph requires the following:

1. Python x, where 2.6 <= x < 3 (Get the windows binary for the latest 2.x.x release: http://www.python.org/download/)
2. A Gtk+ runtime environment (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/)
   - When given the choice during installation, make sure to choose "<instdir>", not "<instdir>\bin" or <instdir\lib>
3. Pygtk, which actually requires three things 
   - pygtk itself (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/)
   - pycairo (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.8/)
   - pygobject (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/2.20/)
4. Numpy (win32 superpack: http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/)
5. Once everything is installed, run graphlab.py with python. (In windows this usually means double clicking on owlgraph.py.)

Using Owl Graph in Linux:

1. Make sure you have python x where 2.6 <= x < 3, as well as pygtk and numpy
   - In stock Ubuntu Lucid, you already have everything but numpy
   - so just run: 
		sudo apt-get install python-numpy
		and you should be good
   - In Ubuntu Precise, you also need python-glade2 ( run sudo apt-get install python-glade2)
2. chmod a+x graphlab.py
3. ./owlgraph.py

Using Owl Graph in OSX:

I hear this is even more of a nightmare than Windows. Good luck.
